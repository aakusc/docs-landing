# Self-Awareness

AICR is the only platform that **queries its own architecture in real time**. Instead of relying on documentation that goes stale, the platform indexes its own canonical docs and exposes them to AI agents as live context.

## What Self-Awareness Means

Traditional platforms document their architecture separately from the running system. AICR makes the documentation a **first-class runtime concern** — agents can ask "what does the canonical architecture say about tenant isolation?" and get a grounded answer from the live docs.

This solves two fundamental problems:
1. **Documentation drift** — docs that describe how things *were*, not how they *are*
2. **Agent hallucination** — AI agents inventing patterns that conflict with the actual architecture

## Canonical Documents

The `docs/canonical/` directory contains **96 canonical documents** covering:

| Category | Examples |
|----------|---------|
| Architecture contracts | Three Laws, Pattern A, tenant isolation rules |
| Model definitions | All 240 table schemas with relationships |
| Pack patterns | How to author, validate, and promote packs |
| Agent protocols | Work item formats, agent roles, memory patterns |
| Control center specs | What each of the 19 control centers owns |
| API contracts | Endpoint schemas and auth requirements |

## How It Works

The KBCC (Knowledge Base Control Center) indexes all canonical documents using pgvector embeddings. When an agent needs context:

```
Agent question → Semantic search in KBCC → Relevant canonical docs retrieved
→ Docs injected as grounding context → Agent responds based on actual architecture
```

## Self-Documentation Requirement

Every architectural change **must update the canonical docs** before it can be promoted. The QA agent validates this as part of the promotion gate:

- New model added → `docs/canonical/models/` must be updated
- New pattern approved → `docs/canonical/patterns/` must reflect it
- Three Laws modified → requires Architect agent sign-off + doc update

This keeps the self-awareness system accurate as the platform evolves.

## Benefits

<Check>Agents always work from current architecture, never stale docs</Check>
<Check>New developers can ask the platform to explain itself</Check>
<Check>Architectural consistency enforced at the documentation level</Check>
<Check>Audit trail of every architectural decision</Check>
