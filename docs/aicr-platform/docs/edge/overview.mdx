# Edge Overview

Edge is the **tenant runtime layer** — where packs run, tenants operate, and business happens. It's the operational heart of AICR.

## What Edge Provides

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Tenant Runtime" icon="server" href="/docs/edge/tenant-runtime">
    Isolated multi-tenant environment with automatic tenantId enforcement and capability scoping

    Deterministic resolution of which packs are active for each tenant
  </Card>
  <Card title="Feature Flags" icon="toggle-on" href="/docs/edge/feature-flags">
    Per-tenant capability overrides and controlled rollouts
  </Card>
  <Card title="Telemetry" icon="chart-line" href="/docs/edge/telemetry">

## 19 Control Centers

The Edge layer exposes **19 Control Centers** — specialized dashboards that each own a specific operational domain:

| Control Center | Code | Responsibility |
|---------------|------|---------------|
| AI Control Center | AICC | AI agent management and work item routing |
| Knowledge Base CC | KBCC | Canonical docs, search, agent memory |
| Governance CC | GOCC | Compliance, audit trails, policy management |
| Document CC | DOCC | Document workflows and version control |
| Integration CC | INCC | External API connections and webhooks |
| QA Control Center | QACC | Test runs, quality gates, pack certification |
| Identity CC | IDCC | Users, roles, permissions, auth flows |
| Operations CC | OPCC | Incidents, deployments, health monitoring |
| + 11 more | — | Domain-specific operations |

## Edge Principles

**Tenants are the unit of operation.** Every action in Edge is scoped to a tenant. The platform guarantees that no tenant can see or affect another's data.

**Packs, not code changes.** Tenants gain new capabilities by activating packs — not by deploying code. The pack resolver handles capability activation without a deployment.

**Observable by default.** All operations emit telemetry. There are no black boxes in Edge.

## Accessing Edge

The Edge layer is the default view when you open the AICR platform. Navigate between control centers using the sidebar. Each control center is itself a pack — they can be extended and customized without modifying the core platform.
