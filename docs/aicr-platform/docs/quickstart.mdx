# Quickstart

Get up and running with the AICR Platform in under 10 minutes.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- **Node.js** 18+ installed
- **pnpm** package manager (`npm install -g pnpm`)
- **Git** for version control
- Access to the **AICodeRally GitHub organization**
- A **Neon PostgreSQL** database (AICR uses Neon exclusively — no Docker)

## 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AICodeRally/AICR.git
cd AICR
```

## 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

This installs dependencies across all apps, packages, and services in the monorepo.

## 3. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in `apps/aicr/`:

```bash
# Database (Neon PostgreSQL — required)
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://...@...neon.tech/aicr?sslmode=require"
DIRECT_URL="postgresql://...@...neon.tech/aicr?sslmode=require"

# Auth (NextAuth v5)
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your-secret-min-32-chars"
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"

# AI — Claude is the primary model
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."

# Optional: additional AI providers
OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY="..."
```

<Note>
AICR enforces **Three Laws**: Neon Everywhere, Neon Branches, Prisma Only. Do not use Docker, SQLite, or direct SQL queries. All database access must go through Prisma.
</Note>

## 4. Set Up the Database

```bash
cd apps/aicr

# Generate Prisma client from the 240-table schema
npx prisma generate

# Push schema to your Neon database
npx prisma db push

# Seed initial data (control centers, roles, default packs)
npx prisma db seed
```

## 5. Start the Development Server

```bash
# From monorepo root
pnpm --filter aicr dev

# Or from the app directory
cd apps/aicr
pnpm dev
```

The platform runs at `http://localhost:3000`.

## What You'll See

On first load, AICR boots into the **Edge layer** — the tenant runtime. From here you can:

- Navigate the **19 Control Centers** from the sidebar
- Open the **AICC** (AI Control Center) to interact with the 14 AI agents
- Browse the **KBCC** (Knowledge Base Control Center) to explore canonical docs
- Access the **Studio** for pack authoring at `/studio`
- Access the **Summit** for marketplace management at `/summit`
