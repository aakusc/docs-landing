# Studio Overview

Studio is the **development and authoring layer** of AICR. It's where developers create capability packs, validate their manifests, and run surface tests before promoting to Edge.

## What Studio Provides

## Studio Principles

**Studio is for authors, not tenants.** Tenants never see Studio. It's a developer workspace where packs are built and validated in isolation.

**Studio packs don't run in production.** A pack with tier `studio` cannot be deployed to Edge. It must be promoted and its tier upgraded as part of the promotion workflow.

**Every pack starts in Studio.** Whether it's a small UI customization or a major workflow pack, all capability development starts here.

## Typical Studio Workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a pack scaffold">
    Use the CLI to generate a pack directory with manifest template, empty surfaces, and test fixtures.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Define the manifest">
    Declare what models, surfaces, and agents the pack provides and what it requires from the platform or other packs.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Build surfaces and schema">
    Implement the React surfaces, Prisma schema extensions, and API routes within the pack boundary.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run validation">
    Run `pnpm pack:validate` to check the manifest against the schema contract and dependency graph.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run surface tests">
    Execute the surface test suite to verify UI behavior, API contracts, and tenant isolation.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Submit for promotion">
    Create a promotion request in the Summit layer. QA agent reviews and approves or returns with feedback.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Studio vs Edge vs Summit

| | Studio | Edge | Summit |
|--|--------|------|--------|
| Who uses it | Developers | Tenant operators | Platform admins |
| Pack state | In development | Deployed to tenants | In marketplace |
| Data | Branch database | Tenant-scoped prod | Platform-wide |
| Gate enforcement | Manifest + tests | Runtime contracts | Promotion approval |
