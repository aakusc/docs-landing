# Development Tools

Studio includes a set of CLI tools and development utilities that streamline pack authoring.

## CLI Reference

```bash
# Create a new pack scaffold
pnpm pack:create --name <pack-name> --tier <studio|edge|summit>

# Validate a pack manifest
pnpm pack:validate --pack <pack-name>

# Run pack tests
pnpm pack:test --pack <pack-name>

# Build pack for promotion
pnpm pack:build --pack <pack-name>

# Submit promotion request
pnpm pack:promote --pack <pack-name> --target edge

# List all packs and their status
pnpm pack:list

# Inspect a pack's resolved dependency graph
pnpm pack:graph --pack <pack-name>
```

## Neon Branch Management

Each developer gets their own Neon database branch. The CLI handles branch lifecycle:

```bash
# Create a branch for your feature
pnpm db:branch --name feature/my-feature

# Push schema changes to your branch
pnpm db:push

# Reset branch to main database state
pnpm db:reset

# Delete branch when done
pnpm db:branch:delete --name feature/my-feature
```

Branches are automatically created on `git checkout -b` via the git hook installed by `pnpm setup`.

## Hot Reload

Studio runs a local development server with hot reload for surface components. Changes to surfaces, API routes, and agent prompts reload instantly without restarting:

```bash
# Start Studio development server
pnpm --filter aicr dev

# Watch a specific pack for changes
pnpm pack:watch --pack approval-workflows
```

## Schema Sync

When you modify a pack's `schema.prisma`, sync it to your Neon branch:

```bash
# Merge pack schemas and push to branch database
pnpm db:sync

# Generate updated Prisma client
pnpm prisma:generate
```

## Debugging

```bash
# Inspect resolved pack capabilities for a tenant
pnpm debug:packs --tenant <tenantId>

# Check Database Guard logs
pnpm debug:guard --last 50

# Replay a failed agent work item
pnpm debug:workitem --id <workItemId>
```
