# Governance Control Center (GOCC)

The GOCC is the compliance and policy hub for the AICR platform. It provides audit trails, policy management, and compliance reporting across all tenants.

## What GOCC Manages

- **Audit trails** — immutable record of all significant platform actions
- **Policy management** — business rules that govern pack behavior
- **Compliance reports** — SOC2, GDPR, CCPA reporting
- **Three Laws monitoring** — alerts if any operation attempts to violate the Three Laws
- **Data subject requests** — GDPR/CCPA request handling workflow

## Audit Trail

Every significant action in AICR is recorded in the audit trail:

| Action | What's recorded |
|--------|----------------|
| Pack activation/deactivation | Actor, tenant, pack, version, timestamp |
| Tenant capability change | Before/after capability set |
| Agent work item | Full context, evidence, outcome |
| User role change | Actor, target user, old/new role |
| Feature flag change | Actor, flag, old/new value |
| Three Laws violation attempt | Full request details (these should never happen) |

## Policy Engine

The GOCC hosts a rules engine for business policies:

```typescript
// Example: Approval policies
{
  policyId: "high-value-approval",
  trigger: "ApprovalRequest.amount > 50000",
  action: "require-cfo-approval",
  chain: "executive-review-chain"
}
```

Policies are evaluated at runtime by the ComplianceAgent and can escalate to human reviewers when thresholds are met.

## Compliance Reports

One-click compliance reports for:
- **SOC2 Type II** — access controls, audit evidence, change management
- **GDPR** — data subject access, retention policies, processing records
- **CCPA** — consumer data requests, opt-out records

Reports are generated by the ComplianceAgent and available for download from the GOCC.
