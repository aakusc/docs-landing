# Knowledge Base Control Center (KBCC)

The KBCC is AICR's self-awareness engine. It indexes all 96 canonical documents, maintains agent memory, and provides semantic search across the platform's knowledge base.

## What KBCC Manages

- **96 canonical documents** — the authoritative record of AICR's architecture
- **Agent memory** — persistent context each agent carries across sessions
- **Semantic search** — find relevant docs by meaning, not just keyword
- **Knowledge graph** — how concepts, models, and packs relate to each other
- **Doc versioning** — history of architectural decisions and changes

## Canonical Documents

The 96 canonical docs are the ground truth for the platform. They cover:

| Category | Count | Examples |
|----------|-------|---------|
| Architecture contracts | 12 | Three Laws, Pattern A, tenant isolation |
| Model definitions | 48 | All 240 tables grouped by domain |
| Pack patterns | 8 | Manifest schema, surface conventions |
| Agent protocols | 6 | Work item formats, agent roles |
| Control center specs | 19 | What each center owns and manages |
| API contracts | 3 | Endpoint schemas, auth requirements |

## Semantic Search

The KnowledgeAgent uses pgvector embeddings to answer natural language questions about the platform:

> "How should I implement multi-tenant data isolation for a new pack?"
> → Returns the tenant isolation contract doc with relevant sections highlighted

## Agent Memory

Each of the 14 agents has a persistent memory store in the KBCC:
- **Session memory** — context from the current conversation
- **Episodic memory** — past decisions and their outcomes
- **Semantic memory** — facts about the platform the agent has learned
- **Procedural memory** — patterns and workflows the agent follows

Memory is queried automatically when an agent starts a new session, providing continuity across conversations.

## Updating Canonical Docs

Canonical docs must be updated when the platform changes. The update process:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Propose a change">
    Create a doc update work item in the AICC with the proposed change and rationale.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Architect agent review">
    The Architect agent reviews the proposed change against existing contracts.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Apply and re-index">
    Once approved, the doc is updated and the KnowledgeAgent re-indexes it. Embeddings are refreshed automatically.
  </Step>
</Steps>
