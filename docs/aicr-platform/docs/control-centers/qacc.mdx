# QA Control Center (QACC)

The QACC is the quality assurance hub. It tracks all test runs, manages quality gates for pack promotions, and maintains the certification status of every pack in the ecosystem.

## What QACC Manages

- **Test runs** — history and results of all surface, contract, and integration tests
- **Quality gates** — pass/fail status for each promotion checkpoint
- **Pack certification** — which pack versions are certified for each tier
- **Regression tracking** — catch regressions introduced by pack or platform updates
- **Coverage reporting** — test coverage trends over time

## Quality Gate Dashboard

The QACC main view shows the current gate status for all packs in the promotion queue:

| Pack | Version | Gate | Status | Blocker |
|------|---------|------|--------|---------|
| approval-workflows | 1.3.0 | Studio → Edge | ✓ Passed | — |
| analytics-suite | 2.0.0 | Edge → Summit | ✗ Blocked | Security audit pending |
| notification-engine | 1.5.1 | Studio → Edge | ⏳ Running | Surface tests in progress |

## Test Run History

Every test run is stored with full output:
- Which tests ran
- Pass/fail status per test
- Failure output and stack traces
- Duration and resource usage
- Which agent (or human) triggered the run

## Pack Certification

A certified pack version is one that has passed all required gates for its target tier. Certification is tracked separately from promotion — a pack can be certified for Edge but not yet listed in the Summit marketplace.

Certification is revoked automatically if:
- A critical security vulnerability is discovered
- A Three Laws violation is found in the pack's code
- The pack's dependencies are revoked

## Running Tests via QACC

QA agent work items can be triggered from the QACC:

```bash
# Trigger a full test run for a pack
pnpm qacc:run --pack approval-workflows --version 1.3.0

# Re-run only failed tests
pnpm qacc:rerun --run-id <runId> --failed-only
```
