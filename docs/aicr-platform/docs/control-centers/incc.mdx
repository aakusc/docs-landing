# Integration Control Center (INCC)

The INCC is the bridge between AICR and the external world. It manages all outbound API connections, inbound webhooks, and data pipeline configurations.

## What INCC Manages

- **API connections** — authenticated connections to external services
- **Webhooks** — inbound event receivers from external platforms
- **Data pipelines** — scheduled or event-driven data import/export flows
- **Alert routing** — routing OpsChief alerts to Slack, email, PagerDuty
- **OAuth apps** — OAuth 2.0 integrations for user-facing external services

## Supported Integrations

| Category | Examples |
|----------|---------|
| Communication | Slack, Microsoft Teams, email (SendGrid, Postmark) |
