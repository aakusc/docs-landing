# Control Centers Overview

AICR is organized into **19 Control Centers** — each a specialized dashboard that owns a specific operational domain. Control centers are themselves packs, meaning they can be extended without modifying the core platform.

## The Control Centers

| Code | Name | Domain |
|------|------|--------|
| **AICC** | AI Control Center | AI agent management, work item routing, model configuration |
| **KBCC** | Knowledge Base CC | Canonical docs, semantic search, agent memory |
| **GOCC** | Governance CC | Compliance, audit trails, policy management |
| **DOCC** | Document CC | Document workflows, version control, templates |
| **INCC** | Integration CC | External APIs, webhooks, data pipelines |
| **QACC** | QA Control Center | Test runs, quality gates, pack certification |
| **IDCC** | Identity CC | Users, roles, permissions, auth configuration |
| **OPCC** | Operations CC | Incidents, deployments, health monitoring, telemetry |
| **TECC** | Tenant CC | Tenant onboarding, configuration, billing |
| **PKCC** | Pack CC | Pack lifecycle, resolver configuration, version management |
| **ANCC** | Analytics CC | Usage analytics, cost tracking, business intelligence |
| **SCCC** | Security CC | Vulnerability scanning, access auditing, compliance |
| **WFCC** | Workflow CC | Cross-pack workflow orchestration |
| **NTCC** | Notification CC | Alerts, email workflows, Slack/webhook routing |
| **MRCC** | Marketplace CC | Pack catalog, partner submissions, pricing |
| **PRCC** | Partner CC | Partner accounts, revenue share, SLA tracking |
| **PLCC** | Policy CC | Business rules engine, approval policies |
| **RTCC** | Reporting CC | Scheduled reports, exports, dashboards |
| **STCC** | Settings CC | Platform configuration, feature flags, environment |

## How Control Centers Work

Each control center:
- Is a **pack** — it has a manifest, surfaces, and optional agents
- **Owns a database domain** — AICC owns AI-related tables, KBCC owns knowledge tables, etc.
- **Communicates via work items** — cross-center operations go through the work item queue
- **Has a dedicated agent** — most centers have a specialized AI agent with domain expertise

## Navigation

From the Edge sidebar, navigate between control centers using the control center menu. The sidebar displays only the centers your tenant has activated. Summit-tier tenants have access to all 19; Studio-tier tenants see only the core set.

## Extending Control Centers

Because control centers are packs, you can extend them:
- Add a new surface (tab or panel) to an existing center
- Register a new agent that works within a center's domain
- Override an existing surface with a custom implementation

Extensions are created in Studio and follow the standard pack promotion workflow.
