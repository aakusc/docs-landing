# Document Control Center (DOCC)

The DOCC manages structured documents within the platform — policies, contracts, reports, and any other content that requires versioning, approval, and lifecycle management.

## What DOCC Manages

- **Document library** — all tenant documents with version history
- **Templates** — reusable document structures for common document types
- **Workflows** — review, approval, and publishing workflows for documents
- **Version control** — full history of every document change with diff view
- **Access control** — who can view, edit, approve, and publish each document

## Document Types

| Type | Examples |
|------|---------|
| Policy | Compensation policies, HR policies, usage policies |
| Contract | Partner agreements, SLAs, vendor contracts |
| Report | Compliance reports, analytics exports, audit summaries |
| Template | Standard document structures for repeated use |
| Knowledge | Internal guides, SOPs, runbooks |

## Document Lifecycle

```
Draft → Review → Approved → Published → Archived
```

Each transition is governed by a configurable workflow. The GOCC integration means all transitions are automatically recorded in the audit trail.

## Version Control

Every save creates a new version. The DOCC stores:
- Full document content at each version
- Who made the change
- What changed (diff view)
- Why it changed (required change reason for published docs)

Documents can be rolled back to any previous version with a single action.
