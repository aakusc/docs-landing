# AI Control Center (AICC)

The AICC is the command center for all AI operations in AICR. It provides visibility into active agents, work item queues, model usage, and agent memory.

## What AICC Manages

- **14 AI agents** — view status, assign work items, review agent output
- **Work item queue** — all pending, in-progress, and completed agent tasks
- **Model configuration** — which AI model each agent uses, fallback models
- **Token usage** — real-time and historical cost tracking per agent
- **Agent memory** — view and manage what each agent remembers across sessions

## Work Items

Work items are the unit of AI operation. Every agent task is a work item with a defined type, assignee, and required evidence:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `type` | build, review, test, deploy, audit, answer |
| `assignedAgent` | Which of the 14 agents handles it |
| `priority` | P0 (critical), P1, P2, P3 |
| `context` | Canonical doc refs, tenantId, packId |
| `status` | pending, in-progress, blocked, complete |
| `evidence` | Required proof of completion |

## Routing Rules

The AICC routes work items based on type and content:
- Code changes → Builder agent
- UI feedback → Designer agent
- Test failures → QA agent
- Security concerns → SecurityAuditor agent
- Architecture questions → Architect agent

Custom routing rules can be configured per tenant.

## Model Configuration

| Agent | Default Model | Notes |
|-------|--------------|-------|
| Builder | claude-sonnet-4-5 | Long context for code generation |
| Designer | claude-sonnet-4-5 | Vision-capable for UI review |
| QA | claude-haiku-4-5 | Fast for automated test analysis |
| KnowledgeAgent | claude-sonnet-4-5 | Semantic retrieval |
| OpsChief | claude-sonnet-4-5 | Incident analysis |

Models can be overridden per work item type via AICC settings.
