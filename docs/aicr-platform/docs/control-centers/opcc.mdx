# Operations Control Center (OPCC)

The OPCC is the operational backbone of AICR. It provides real-time health monitoring, incident management, deployment tracking, and the telemetry dashboard for the platform.

## What OPCC Manages

- **Platform health** — real-time status of all services and control centers
- **Incident management** — P0-P3 incident lifecycle with OpsChief agent
- **Deployment history** — record of all pack promotions and platform updates
- **Telemetry** — usage metrics, error rates, latency, cost per operation
- **Alerts** — configuration and history of all active alert rules
- **On-call** — rotation schedules and escalation paths

## Health Dashboard

The OPCC health dashboard shows real-time status:

| Service | Status | Latency (p99) | Error Rate |
|---------|--------|---------------|------------|
| API Gateway | ✅ Healthy | 142ms | 0.01% |
| Pack Resolver | ✅ Healthy | 28ms | 0.00% |
| Agent Conductor | ✅ Healthy | — | 0.00% |
| Database (Neon) | ✅ Healthy | 18ms | 0.00% |
| KBCC Search | ✅ Healthy | 210ms | 0.02% |

## Incident Management

Incidents are classified by priority:

| Priority | Response Time | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **P0** | Immediate | Platform down, data loss risk, security breach |
| **P1** | < 1 hour | Major feature unavailable, significant performance degradation |
| **P2** | < 4 hours | Minor feature degraded, elevated error rate |
| **P3** | Next business day | Cosmetic issues, non-critical bugs |

P0 and P1 incidents automatically create an OpsChief agent work item and trigger the on-call alert via the INCC.

## OpsChief Agent

The OpsChief agent handles incident response:
1. Analyzes telemetry to identify the root cause
2. Checks deployment history for recent changes
3. Proposes remediation steps
4. Executes safe automated remediations (restarts, rollbacks)
5. Escalates to human operator when manual intervention is needed

## Deployment Tracking

Every platform change is recorded:
- Pack promotions and rollbacks
- Platform version updates
- Infrastructure changes
- Neon migration runs

The deployment timeline view correlates deployments with telemetry spikes, making root cause analysis faster.
