# Capability Mapping

Capability mapping gives platform admins a complete picture of what every tenant can do — which packs are active, which surfaces are enabled, and how capabilities relate to each other.

## What is a Capability Map?

A capability map is a tenant's full resolved capability set:

```json
{
  "tenantId": "tenant-abc",
  "tier": "edge",
  "resolvedAt": "2026-02-26T10:00:00Z",
  "capabilities": {
    "core": { "version": "1.5.0", "surfaces": ["navigation", "settings", "profile"] },
    "identity-management": { "version": "2.1.0", "surfaces": ["users", "roles", "permissions"] },
    "approval-workflows": { "version": "1.2.0", "surfaces": ["approvals-dashboard", "approval-form"] }
  },
  "featureFlagOverrides": {
    "new-dashboard-v2": false
  }
}
```

## Cross-Tenant View

Summit admins can view capability maps across all tenants:

```bash
# Which tenants have approval-workflows active?
pnpm capabilities:query --pack approval-workflows

# What capabilities does tenant-abc have?
pnpm capabilities:map --tenant tenant-abc

# Which tenants are on outdated pack versions?
pnpm capabilities:audit --outdated
```

## Capability Dependencies

The dependency graph shows how packs relate to each other across the ecosystem. This helps identify:
- Which packs would break if a core pack changes
- Tenants that need migration when a pack is deprecated
- Capability gaps — tenants that should have a pack but don't

## Gap Analysis

The MarketplaceAgent can run a gap analysis to identify tenants that are eligible for additional packs based on their tier and usage patterns:

```bash
pnpm capabilities:gap-analysis --tier edge
# → 23 Edge tenants are eligible for "approval-workflows" but haven't activated it
# → 8 Edge tenants would benefit from "analytics-suite" based on their API usage
```

This surfaces upsell opportunities and helps platform admins proactively improve tenant outcomes.
