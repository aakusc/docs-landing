# Promotion Workflows

Promotion is the process of moving a pack from development (Studio) → tenant runtime (Edge) → marketplace (Summit). Each transition requires passing a gate enforced by AICR agents.

## Promotion Path

```
Studio (authoring)
    ↓  Gate: manifest valid + tests pass
Edge (tenant runtime)
    ↓  Gate: 30-day stability + security audit
Summit (marketplace)
```

## Studio → Edge Promotion

**Trigger:** Developer submits promotion request via CLI or Studio UI.

**Gate checks (automated):**

| Check | Owner |
|-------|-------|
| Manifest schema valid | Validator |
| All dependencies resolvable | Pack resolver |
| Surface tests pass (≥80% coverage) | QA agent |
| Contract tests pass | QA agent |
| Tenant isolation tests pass | DataEngineer agent |
| No Pattern A violations | DataEngineer agent |
| Canonical doc references valid | KnowledgeAgent |

If all checks pass, the pack is available for tenant activation on Edge. The QA agent posts a promotion summary to the work item thread.

**Estimated time:** Minutes (fully automated)

## Edge → Summit Promotion

**Trigger:** Platform admin or MarketplaceAgent submits marketplace listing request.

**Gate checks (semi-automated):**

| Check | Owner |
|-------|-------|
| 30 days runtime stability | OpsChief agent (automated) |
| Zero P0 errors in stability period | OpsChief agent (automated) |
| Security audit complete | SecurityAuditor agent |
| GDPR/compliance audit | ComplianceAgent |
| Full documentation complete | MarketplaceAgent (review) |
| Pricing and licensing defined | ProductManager (manual) |

**Estimated time:** 1-2 weeks

## Rollback

Any promotion can be rolled back:

```bash
# Roll back a pack version for all tenants
pnpm pack:rollback --pack approval-workflows --version 1.2.0

# Roll back for a specific tenant only
pnpm pack:rollback --pack approval-workflows --tenant <tenantId>
```

Rollback is immediate — the pack resolver switches to the previous version within the next cache refresh.

## Promotion Audit Trail

Every promotion and rollback is recorded with:
- Timestamp and actor
- Gate check results
- Agent review notes
- Version being promoted/rolled back

Accessible from the GOCC audit log.
