# Pack Marketplace

The Pack Marketplace is where approved packs are listed for discovery and distribution. Platform admins, enterprise tenants, and partners can browse, evaluate, and activate packs from here.

## Marketplace Catalog

Each pack listing includes:
- Name, description, and version history
- Required platform version and dependencies
- Surfaces and capabilities provided
- Promotion history and stability record
- Author (BHG first-party or verified partner)
- Usage statistics (number of active tenants)

## Pack Categories

| Category | Examples |
|----------|---------|
| **Workflow** | Approval chains, document review, onboarding |
| **Analytics** | Dashboards, reports, cost tracking |
| **Communication** | Notifications, email workflows, Slack integration |
| **Compliance** | Audit trails, GDPR tooling, SOC2 controls |
| **AI** | Specialized agent prompts, knowledge base extensions |
| **Integration** | CRM connectors, payment gateways, data imports |

## Activating a Pack

Platform admins can activate marketplace packs for specific tenants or all tenants from the Summit dashboard:

```bash
# Activate from CLI
pnpm marketplace:activate --pack approval-workflows@1.2.0 --tenant <tenantId>

# Activate for all tenants on Edge tier
pnpm marketplace:activate --pack approval-workflows@1.2.0 --tier edge
```

## Publishing to the Marketplace

Packs promoted from Studio → Edge are eligible for marketplace listing once they meet:
- 30 days of runtime stability on at least 3 tenants
- SecurityAuditor sign-off
- Complete documentation (all surfaces and agents documented)
- ComplianceAgent audit for data handling

The MarketplaceAgent manages the review queue and notifies authors of approval or required changes.

## Partner Packs

Verified partners can publish packs to the marketplace. Partner packs are reviewed by the MarketplaceAgent and must meet the same stability and documentation requirements as first-party packs.

Partner packs are labeled clearly in the catalog and include the partner's verified status badge.
