# Tenants API

Programmatically manage tenant environments — useful for automated onboarding, infrastructure scripts, and partner integrations.

## List Tenants

```http
GET /api/tenants
```

Requires `tenants:read` scope. Returns all tenants accessible to the API key.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "tenants": [
      {
        "id": "tenant-abc",
        "slug": "acme-corp",
        "tier": "edge",
        "status": "active",
        "createdAt": "2026-01-15T00:00:00Z"
      }
    ],
    "total": 12
  }
}
```

## Get Tenant

```http
GET /api/tenants/:tenantId
```

Returns tenant details including active packs and capability map.

## Create Tenant

```http
POST /api/tenants
```

**Body:**
```json
{
  "slug": "acme-corp",
  "name": "Acme Corporation",
  "tier": "edge",
  "adminEmail": "admin@acme.com",
  "packs": ["approval-workflows", "analytics-suite"]
}
```

Creates the tenant, activates core packs for the tier, and sends an onboarding email to `adminEmail`.

## Update Tenant

```http
PATCH /api/tenants/:tenantId
```

Update tenant name, tier, or configuration. Tier upgrades activate additional packs automatically.

## Suspend Tenant

```http
POST /api/tenants/:tenantId/suspend
```

Suspends a tenant. All API access for that tenant is blocked. Data is retained.

## Delete Tenant

```http
DELETE /api/tenants/:tenantId
```

Permanently deletes a tenant and all associated data. This action is irreversible and requires `admin` scope. A 24-hour delay is enforced before deletion executes.
