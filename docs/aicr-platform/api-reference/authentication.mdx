# Authentication

The AICR API uses **API keys** for machine-to-machine authentication. API keys are managed through the IDCC (Identity Control Center).

## Creating an API Key

1. Navigate to **IDCC → API Keys**
2. Click **Create API Key**
3. Set a name, expiry, and permission scope
4. Copy the key — it's only shown once

## Using an API Key

Include the key in the `Authorization` header:

```http
GET /api/tenants
Authorization: Bearer aicr_live_abc123...
```

## API Key Scopes

Keys are scoped to specific permissions. Always use the minimum scope needed:

| Scope | Access |
|-------|--------|
| `tenants:read` | List and view tenant configurations |
| `tenants:write` | Create and modify tenants |
| `packs:read` | List packs and view pack status |
| `packs:write` | Activate, deactivate, and configure packs |
| `agents:read` | View agent status and work item results |
| `agents:write` | Submit work items and invoke agents |
| `admin` | Full platform access (use with care) |

## Key Rotation

Rotate keys regularly. The IDCC supports zero-downtime rotation:

1. Create a new key with the same scopes
2. Update your integration to use the new key
3. Revoke the old key

## Environment Keys

Use separate keys for each environment:
- `aicr_live_...` — production
- `aicr_test_...` — staging/testing

Test keys operate against your Neon branch database and cannot affect production data.
