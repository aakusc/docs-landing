## What's in the Platform Core

The Rally Stack platform core is the set of systems that run underneath every app you build. You don't interact with most of these directly — they handle the infrastructure so your modules and apps don't have to.

## Core Responsibilities

| System | Responsibility |
|--------|---------------|
| **Module Registry** | Indexes all 130+ modules with contracts and metadata |
| **Rally AI Framework** | Routes AI tasks to the right model and ALM |
| **Agent Protocol** | Defines how AI agents communicate, hand off, and remember |
| **Three Laws Enforcement** | Runtime validation of Neon + Prisma rules |
| **Pack Compiler** | Bundles modules into versioned AICR packs |
| **Turborepo** | Orchestrates builds, tests, and deploys across the monorepo |

## Module Registry

The module registry is the central catalog of all capabilities in Rally Stack. When you compose an app, the registry:

1. Validates that requested modules exist and are at compatible versions
2. Resolves dependencies between modules
3. Checks that module input/output contracts align
4. Generates the composition graph for the AI to work from

The registry is queryable at runtime — AI agents can ask "what modules handle commission calculation?" and get back a ranked list.

## Three Laws Enforcement

The platform enforces the three locked laws at startup and at every database operation:

```typescript
// guard.ts — runs before every DB call
export function enforceThreeLaws(operation: DBOperation) {
  assert(operation.client === 'prisma', 'THREE LAWS: Prisma only');
  assert(operation.provider === 'neon', 'THREE LAWS: Neon only');
  // Branch enforcement is at CI/CD level
}
```

Any attempt to bypass Prisma (raw SQL clients, direct pg connections) will throw at runtime, not just at lint time.

## Pack Compiler

When you're ready to deploy Rally Stack modules to an AICR tenant, the pack compiler:

1. Takes a composition graph (module selections + configuration)
2. Validates all contracts are satisfied
3. Generates a versioned pack manifest (compatible with AICR's pack system)
4. Produces a deployable artifact

This is the bridge between Rally Stack (build) and AICR (run).
