## What are Modules?

Modules are **self-contained, reusable capability units** — the building blocks of every Rally Stack application. Each module:

- Does one thing well
- Exposes a typed contract (inputs, outputs, dependencies)
- Can be composed with other modules
- Works across Studio, Edge, and Summit tiers

Modules are not apps. They're the parts catalog that apps are assembled from.

## Module Contract

Every module exports a typed contract that the registry uses for validation and composition:

```typescript
interface ModuleContract {
  id: string;           // unique identifier, e.g. 'spm-quota-manager'
  version: string;      // semver
  category: ModuleCategory;
  inputs: ZodSchema;    // validated input shape
  outputs: ZodSchema;   // guaranteed output shape
  dependencies: string[]; // other modules required
  aiCapable: boolean;   // has an AI Lifecycle Manager
  description: string;
}
```

The contract is the source of truth for what a module does and what it needs. The AI uses contracts to assemble applications — it doesn't read source code.

## Using Modules

Add a module to any app in the monorepo:

```bash
pnpm add --filter web @rally/spm
```

Then import from its public API:

```typescript
import { QuotaManager, useQuota } from '@rally/spm';
```

## AI-Capable Modules

Modules marked `aiCapable: true` have an embedded AI Lifecycle Manager. When the Rally AI Framework is active, these modules can:

- Answer natural language queries about their domain
- Suggest configurations based on context
- Generate reports and insights autonomously

SPM modules are the most AI-capable category, with SGM SPARCC being the primary example.

## Finding the Right Module

Use the module registry query in your app:

```typescript
import { registry } from '@rally/core';

// Search by category
const spmModules = registry.search({ category: 'spm' });

// Search by capability keyword
const commissionModules = registry.search({ keywords: ['commission'] });

// Check if a module exists
const exists = registry.has('spm-commission-calculator');
```

Or browse by category in the sidebar.
