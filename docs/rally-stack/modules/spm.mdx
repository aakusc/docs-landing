## Overview

SPM (Sales Performance Management) modules are Rally Stack's most sophisticated category. They handle the full lifecycle of sales compensation and performance management — from territory design and quota setting to incentive calculation and payout.

The **SPM Spark Suite** is the flagship application built from these modules, targeting enterprise ICM (Incentive Compensation Management) use cases.

## SPM Spark Suite

The SPM Spark Suite is a collection of 6–8 tools being built at BHG:

| Tool | Status | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| **SGM SPARCC** | Production | AI-powered sales quota and commission calculator |
| **Commission Calculator** | Production | Real-time commission tool with what-if and Monte Carlo |
| **SPOT — ICM Connector** | In Development | Universal ICM data extractor (Verisent, Exactly, CapIQ) |
| **Territory Manager** | Planned | Geographic and account-based territory design |
| **Roles & Hierarchies** | Planned | Sales org structure and reporting relationships |
| **Pay Curves** | Planned | Incentive curve design and visualization |
| **Monte Carlo Simulator** | Planned | Statistical modeling for comp plan design |
| **Plan Builder** | Planned | End-to-end comp plan authoring |

## Modules

### Quota Management

| Module | ID | Description |
|--------|-----|-------------|
| **SGM SPARCC** | `spm-sparcc` | AI-powered quota modeling with market analysis (SPARCC framework) |
| **Quota Manager** | `spm-quota` | Quota assignment, approval workflows, and tracking |
| **Quota Allocation** | `spm-allocation` | Top-down quota cascading across org hierarchy |
| **Attainment Tracker** | `spm-attainment` | Real-time quota vs. actuals with period-end projections |

### Commission Calculation

| Module | ID | Description |
|--------|-----|-------------|
| **Commission Calculator** | `spm-commission-calc` | Point-of-sale commission calculation with plan rule engine |
| **Plan Rule Engine** | `spm-rules` | Flexible rule definitions: tiers, accelerators, draws, clawbacks |
| **Monte Carlo** | `spm-monte-carlo` | Statistical simulation for comp plan modeling |
| **Earnings Visibility** | `spm-earnings` | Rep-facing real-time earnings and what-if scenarios |

### Territory Management

| Module | ID | Description |
|--------|-----|-------------|
| **Territory Designer** | `spm-territory` | Geographic and account-based territory carving |
| **Alignment Manager** | `spm-alignment` | Rep-to-territory assignment and change management |
| **Coverage Analysis** | `spm-coverage` | White space identification and territory optimization |

### Integrations (ICM Connectors)

| Module | ID | Description |
|--------|-----|-------------|
| **SPOT Connector** | `spm-spot` | Universal ICM rule extraction — Verisent, Exactly, CapIQ |
| **Salesforce Sync** | `spm-sf-sync` | Bidirectional sync with Salesforce compensation data |
| **Workday Connector** | `spm-workday` | Workday HCM integration for org hierarchy and roles |

## SGM SPARCC

SGM SPARCC is the primary AI-powered module in the SPM suite. SPARCC stands for:

- **S** — Sales motion analysis
- **P** — Pipeline and market data
- **A** — AI-driven modeling
- **R** — Role and territory mapping
- **C** — Competitive benchmarking
- **C** — Commission plan optimization

SPARCC takes historical performance data, market benchmarks, and organizational constraints as inputs and generates defensible quota recommendations with supporting rationale.

## Commission Calculator

Built from Calladus source code, the Commission Calculator provides:

- **Point-of-sale commission** — instant calculation as deals close
- **What-if scenarios** — "what would I earn if I close this deal?"
- **Monte Carlo simulation** — probability distributions over expected earnings
- **Plan rule extraction** — paste your comp plan; AI extracts the rules

Initial target customer: **Mattress Firm** (high-volume, simple tier structure).

## SPOT — ICM Connector

SPOT (Sales Performance Operations Tool) extracts compensation rule concepts from existing ICM systems:

1. **Connect** to source ICM (Verisent, Exactly, CapIQ)
2. **Extract** plan rules, logic, and data structures
3. **Normalize** to Rally Stack's unified rule format
4. **Feed** into the Plan Rule Engine for calculation

Being built by Aaron + Keshav. Solves the ICM migration problem — extracting institutional knowledge locked in legacy systems.

## AI Features

SPM modules are Rally Stack's most AI-capable category:

- **SGM SPARCC** — full AI quota modeling with market benchmarking
- **Commission Calculator** — natural language plan rule extraction + Monte Carlo
- **SPOT Connector** — AI-assisted rule interpretation from ICM exports
- **Coverage Analysis** — AI-generated territory recommendations

## Example Usage

```typescript
import { CommissionCalculator } from '@rally/spm-commission-calc';

export async function RepCommissionPage({ tenantId, repId }: Props) {
  return (
    <CommissionCalculator
      tenantId={tenantId}
      repId={repId}
      showWhatIf
      showMonteCarlo
    />
  );
}
```
